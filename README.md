# KNAGLOCATOR

Knag Locator official opensource game.

--------------------------------------------

This is a small python game to play when you are bored.

You probably know of the little game we all play, when someone
takes a coin or something, puts it in his hand, and then
puts his hands behind his back, shuffles them, and askes the other
person where they think the coin is. They might say left and it could be left,
and they might win. They might say right but it could be left and then they
loose. That is the whole game. We all know of it.

This is a digitized version of that game.

If you are a network admin, you can play this game in those death hours when you literally
have nothing to do. Or, if you want to, just play it when you want to do something fun!

Left or right is randomly selected by the game, and the player is asked 5 times where knag is.
For context, knag is a little kangaroo plushie, whose picture is at the bottom of this file.
On every round of the 5 rounds, the random location is (randomly obviously) changed.
Finally their score is displayed.

That is how to play the game.

If you are playing on linux you obviously need "python3".

1) Go to the directory where the main.py file is.
2) Type the command --> python3 ./main.py
3) Play the game! :)
